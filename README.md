# Maker's Week 2: Weekly challenge
This challenge was the second of my Maker's weekly challenges, coded in pairs with a randomised partner each day.
The learning objectives for this week were:

* Class splitting to adhere to SRP
* Mocking and decoupling classes in tests
* Testing behaviour over state
* OOP and its' benefits
* Dependency injection



**Oystercard**
***
Oystercard is a simple tool to allow your Oystercard to calculate the balance and allow you to use it on TFL. 

* It allows a user to create an Oystercard with a default amount, and to add to this balance on the fly. 
* The program also sets limits matching those of real Oystercards, and correctly deducts based on your journey.
* The card also stores journies and allows users to access them later. 

***

The purpose of this program is to practice the appropriate usage of TDD principles to allow the seamless integration of new features.
