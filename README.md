Oystercard is a simple tool to allow your Oystercard to calculate the balance and allow you to use it on TFL. 
* It allows a user to create an Oystercard with a default amount, and to add to this balance on the fly. 
* The program also sets limits matching those of real Oystercards, and correctly deducts based on your journey.
